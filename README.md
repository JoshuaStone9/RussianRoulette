# RussianRoulette
A simple C# console application that simulates a game of Russian Roulette using randomization and user input. The player selects a chamber number and lets fate decide whether they survive or meet an unfortunate end.  This project focuses on basic control flow, array manipulation and randomness in a console-based environment.
